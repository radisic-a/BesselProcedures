# BesselProcedures
This project deals with the problem of Bessel procedures and processes in solving the main geodetic problems on an ellipsoid.
There are number of methods for solving the main geodetic tasks on the Earth's ellipsoid. They can be grouped into three categories, ie models for: short distances (up to 200km), medium distances (200 to 1000km) and long distances (over 1000km). The aim of this project is the application of the methodology for solving the main geodetic tasks for all distances on the ellipsoid, ie the application of one universal method. Since this method is iterative, the modern way of its implementation is a significant relief compared to its application in the past when there were no software designs and automated procedures. From the obtained results and length values, numerous analysis and conclusions can be derived, ie, process monitoring and error growth trend with increasing distance.
